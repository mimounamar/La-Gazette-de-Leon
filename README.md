# La Gazette de Léon 
Welcome to La Gazette de Léon's repository. La Gazette de Léon is LÉON L'AFRICAIN's high school newspaper. The current repository contains the code that runs the online version of the newspaper (including its editor's space).
 ## Main features 
 Built using ReactJS and Django, La Gazette de Léon includes the following features: 
 - A front-end and back-end to handle each edition's teamwork (whether the edition is digital or in paper format). 
 -  The ability to create a new edition, associate each article to the chosen editor(s) and corrector. 
 -  A Google Docs-ish interface built using Web Socket to allow editors working in the same article while seeing each other's modifications. 
 - Still in progress (delayed due to administrative issues): Reader's interface, which will allow reading the published articles digitally. 
 - Integration with SMTP to allow password recovery.
